# Part 2 - Training and Testing Data Writeup

After completing `a6_part2.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What makes this model more effective than the model you created in the previous lesson?
This model uses more data points which will make it more accurate than models that have less, like the model in the previous lesson.

2. What does the R squared coefficient tell you about the model?
The R Squared value tells us that there is a small correlation because it is a low value. The lower the r squared value, the lower the correlation between two things is.

3. Would you say that your model is accurate? What evidence supports your conclusion? Consider the meaning of the predicted and actual values in the context of the chart below from the American Heart Associationâ€™s website on understanding blood pressure.
I think that the model is not accurate because of the fact that the data is so scattered and all over the place. There is no real correleation or trend
