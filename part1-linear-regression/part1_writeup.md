# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this lenear regression model?

r squared = 0.6257932855322312. This means that blood pressure and age aren't really related.

2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person iwho is 43 years old?

The predicted blood pressure for a person who is 43 years old is 137.46185286

3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?

I don't think the model's predictions are very accurate because of the pretty low r squared value. Although, the predicted blood pressure for someone who is 43 years old was pretty accurate. So I think it can be accurate for the average person, but not for those that have other conditions that could affect blood pressure.  To improve the model you could collect more or better data.
